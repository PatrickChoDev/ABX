# ABX: Adorable kernel But not UNIX

This kernel is made from `zero line of code` with [Rust](http://rust-lang.org). I'm not sure wheter it faster than GNU/[Linux](http://kernel.org) processes which was written in [C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html). This kernel is for **my hobbies** and **educational purpose** only

**TD;LR** : I don't sure cause of my impementations and runtime conditionals.
